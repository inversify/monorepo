# InversifyHttpAdapter

The base class all HTTP adapters extend (Express 4/5, Fastify, Hono, etc.). It wires controllers, guards, pipes, middleware, and interceptors into a working HTTP server. You generally consume its public methods from an adapter instance; if you are building a new adapter, implement the protected abstract methods described below.

## Type parameters

```ts
class InversifyHttpAdapter<
  TRequest,
  TResponse,
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
  TNextFunction extends (err?: any) => Promise<void> | void,
  TResult,
  TOptions extends HttpAdapterOptions = HttpAdapterOptions,
>
```

- TRequest: Native request type from the underlying framework (e.g., `express.Request`, `FastifyRequest`, `HonoRequest`).
- TResponse: Native response type from the underlying framework (e.g., `express.Response`, `FastifyReply`, `Context`).
- TNextFunction: Native “next” function type for chaining handlers.
- TResult: Adapter-specific return type for handlers and replies.
- TOptions: Adapter options shape. Defaults to `HttpAdapterOptions`.

## Constructor

```ts
constructor(
  container: Container,
  defaultHttpAdapterOptions: RequiredOptions<TOptions>,
  httpAdapterOptions: TOptions | undefined,
  awaitableRequestMethodParamTypes?: Iterable<RequestMethodParameterType> | undefined,
)
```

Creates an adapter instance bound to a DI container. Adapters typically invoke this from their subclass constructor and then expose a `build()` method that prepares the server.

- container: The Inversify container that holds controllers, guards, pipes, middleware, interceptors, and filters.
- defaultHttpAdapterOptions: The baseline options; merged with `httpAdapterOptions`.
- httpAdapterOptions: Optional overrides. If `logger` is not `false`, route mappings will be logged on build.
- awaitableRequestMethodParamTypes: Parameter types that should be awaited when building controller method arguments (e.g., when a parameter is resolved asynchronously). See parameter decorators under <Link to="../../fundamentals/controller">Controller</Link>.

## Public methods

### applyGlobalMiddleware

```ts
applyGlobalMiddleware(
  ...middlewareList: (Newable<Middleware> | ApplyMiddlewareOptions)[]
): void
```

Registers global middleware to run for every route.

- middlewareList: Either middleware classes or a structured object with `preHandlerMiddlewareList` and `postHandlerMiddlewareList` to control the phase. See <Link to="../../fundamentals/middleware">Middleware</Link>.

Notes:
- Must be called before the server is built; calling it after `build()` throws an error.
- Pre-handler middleware run before the controller handler (after guards); post-handler middleware run after the handler.

### useGlobalFilters

```ts
useGlobalFilters(
  ...errorFilterList: Newable<ErrorFilter>[]
): void
```

Registers global error filters. When a handler, guard, pipe, middleware, or interceptor throws, the adapter looks up the most specific filter whose handled `Error` type matches the thrown error (by walking the prototype chain), or a catch-all filter bound to `null` if provided.

- errorFilterList: Error filter classes to register globally.

Behavior:
- If no filter handles the error, an `InternalServerError` response is produced unless the error itself is an `ErrorHttpResponse`, which is sent as-is.

### applyGlobalGuards

```ts
applyGlobalGuards(
  ...guardList: Newable<Guard<TRequest>>[]
): void
```

Registers global guards that run before middleware and route handlers. See <Link to="../../fundamentals/guard">Guard</Link>.

- guardList: Guard classes to evaluate for every request.

Notes:
- Must be called before the server is built; calling it after `build()` throws an error.
- If any guard returns `false`, a `403 Forbidden` is returned (unless the guard throws a specific `ErrorHttpResponse`).

### useGlobalInterceptors

```ts
useGlobalInterceptors(
  ...interceptorList: Newable<Interceptor<TRequest, TResponse>>[]
): void
```

Registers global interceptors that wrap route execution. Interceptors can run logic before and after the handler and may transform the handler result. See <Link to="../../fundamentals/interceptor">Interceptor</Link>.

- interceptorList: Interceptor classes to apply globally.

Notes:
- Must be called before the server is built; calling it after `build()` throws an error.

### useGlobalPipe

```ts
useGlobalPipe(
  ...pipeList: (Newable<Pipe> | Pipe)[]
): void
```

Registers global pipes that transform/validate controller method parameters immediately after extraction. See <Link to="../../fundamentals/pipe">Pipe</Link>.

- pipeList: Pipe classes or instances. Instances are used as provided; classes are resolved from the container per request.

Order of execution:
- Global pipes run before parameter-level pipes declared via parameter decorators (e.g., `@Body(ParseNumberPipe)`).

### build

```ts
build(): Promise<unknown>
```

Abstract. Implemented by concrete adapters to build and return the underlying HTTP server or framework instance.
