# Inversify binding decorators

The `@inversifyjs/binding-decorators` package provides a set of handy decorators that streamline configuring bindings in your InversifyJS Container. Instead of manually calling `bind` for each service, you can use decorators like `@provide()` to declare and organize dependencies close to their implementation.

## When to use it

Use binding decorators when you prefer annotation-driven configuration that:

- Reduces container setup boilerplate
- Keeps bindings co-located with class definitions
- Improves discoverability of services in larger codebases

If you need fully programmatic or dynamic binding logic, traditional module / container binding code may still be more appropriate.

## Key features

- `@provide()` decorator to auto-register classes
- Support for named and tagged bindings
- Layered on top of the core container so it stays optional
