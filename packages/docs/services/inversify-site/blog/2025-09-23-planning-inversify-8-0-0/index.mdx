title: Planning InversifyJS 8 - Feedback Needed!
authors: [notaphplover]
tags: [releases]

We're excited to share that we've begun planning the next major release of InversifyJS: **version 8.0.0**! Unlike previous major releases, we're committed to keeping breaking changes to a minimum while focusing on improvements that enhance type safety, consistency, and maintainability.

**We're targeting March 2026 for the InversifyJS 8.0.0 release**, giving us ample time to gather community feedback, refine the proposed changes, and ensure a smooth transition for all users.

## A Community-Driven Approach

For this release, we're taking a different approach. Instead of planning breaking changes in isolation, **we want your input early in the process**. We believe that gathering community feedback during the planning phase will help us deliver the highest quality software that truly serves your needs.

## Proposed Breaking Changes

We've identified **three specific areas** for potential breaking changes in v8. Each change is designed to improve the library's consistency, type safety, or maintainability:

### 1. Improved Type Safety for Service Identifiers

**[Issue #1071: Update ServiceIdentifier without Function](https://github.com/inversify/monorepo/issues/1071)**

We're proposing to remove the generic `Function` type from `ServiceIdentifier`, which would improve TypeScript's type inference and provide better developer experience. This change would:

- Enhance type safety and IDE support
- Resolve type system issues reported by the community
- Require classes with protected/private constructors to use symbols as service identifiers instead

### 2. Consistent Naming Conventions

**[Issue #1049: Rename Container.loadSync and Container.load](https://github.com/inversify/monorepo/issues/1049)**

To align with our established naming patterns, we're considering:

- Renaming `Container.loadSync` to `Container.load` (synchronous by default)
- Renaming `Container.load` to `Container.loadAsync` (async operations use the "Async" suffix)

This would bring consistency to our API where async methods are clearly marked with the "Async" suffix.

### 3. Library Simplification

**[Issue #1048: Remove Provider](https://github.com/inversify/monorepo/issues/1048)**

Since v6, `Provider` has been superseded by `Factory`, which offers the same functionality with better flexibility. Removing `Provider` would:

- Simplify the library and reduce maintenance overhead
- Encourage migration to the more powerful `Factory` pattern
- Reduce the learning curve for new users

## We Need Your Feedback!

These changes are **proposals, not final decisions**. We want to hear from you:

- **Are these changes valuable for your use cases?**
- **Would any of these changes significantly impact your codebase?**
- **Do you have suggestions for smoother migration paths?**
- **Are there other improvements you'd like to see in v8?**

## How to Participate

Visit our GitHub issues tagged with [V8](https://github.com/inversify/monorepo/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AV8) to:

1. **Comment on individual issues** with your thoughts and use cases
2. **Share migration concerns** or suggestions
3. **Propose additional improvements** for v8
4. **Vote with reactions** (👍/👎) to express your support or concerns

Your feedback directly influences our decisions. Every comment helps us understand the real-world impact of these changes and ensures we're building something that truly serves the InversifyJS community.

## What's Next?

Based on your feedback, we'll:

1. **Refine the proposed changes** to address community concerns
2. **Provide detailed migration guides** for any breaking changes we decide to implement
3. **Release alpha/beta versions** throughout 2025 to help you test changes before the final release
4. **Continue the conversation** as we develop v8 toward our **March 2026 target release**

This timeline gives us plenty of opportunity to iterate on the design, gather real-world feedback from alpha/beta testing, and ensure that v8 delivers meaningful improvements without unnecessary disruption.

## A Collaborative Future

InversifyJS has always been about empowering developers to build better applications through clean dependency injection. Version 8 represents our commitment to evolving the library thoughtfully, with the community at the center of our decision-making process.

**Thank you for being part of the InversifyJS community.** Your projects, contributions, and feedback make this library better every day.
