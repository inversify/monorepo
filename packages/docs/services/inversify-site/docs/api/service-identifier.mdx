# ServiceIdentifier

## Overview

`ServiceIdentifier` is a fundamental type that identifies services within the InversifyJS dependency injection container. It serves as a key for registering, locating, and retrieving services, acting as a bridge between service registration and resolution.

## Definition

`ServiceIdentifier` is a union type that can be one of:

```typescript
type ServiceIdentifier<TInstance = unknown> =
  | string
  | symbol
  | Newable<TInstance>
  | AbstractNewable<TInstance>;
```

Where `Newable` is defined as:

```typescript
type Newable<
  TInstance = unknown,
  TArgs extends unknown[] = any[],
> = new (...args: TArgs) => TInstance;
```

## Usage

`ServiceIdentifier` is used throughout the InversifyJS API for:

1. **Service Registration**: Binding services to the container
2. **Service Resolution**: Retrieving services from the container
3. **Service Configuration**: Setting activation/deactivation handlers

### Examples

:::info[Type Inference support]

When using generics with `ServiceIdentifier<T>`, TypeScript can infer the resolved type. In the example above, `firstUserService` is automatically typed as `UserService` because `UserService` is inferred as `ServiceIdentifier<UserService>`.

:::

:::warning[Assignment reduced type]

In TypeScript, when a variable annotated with a union is assigned, the actual initial type of that variable becomes "an assignment reduced type".

In the example above, `userServiceId` is automatically reduced as `symbol` and therefore, `firstUserService` is typed as `unknown`.
Using a casting prevents this reduction and maintains the original type. Consider `fourthUserService` as an example.
