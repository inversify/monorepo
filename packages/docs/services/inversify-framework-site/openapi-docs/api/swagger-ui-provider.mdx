# SwaggerUiProvider

The `SwaggerUiProvider` is a class that generates and provides Swagger UI documentation for your HTTP controllers. It automatically scans your controllers and their OpenAPI metadata to build a complete OpenAPI 3.1 specification and serves it through a Swagger UI interface.

## Core Methods

### provide

Registers the Swagger UI provider with the dependency injection container and builds the OpenAPI documentation from controller metadata.

```ts
provide(container: Container): void
```

Parameters

- container (Container): The Inversify container instance where controllers are registered.

Notes

- Scope: Can only be called once per provider instance. Subsequent calls will throw an error.
- Process: Scans all registered controllers for OpenAPI metadata, builds the complete OpenAPI specification, and registers the Swagger UI controller.
- Prerequisites: Controllers must be properly registered in the container and have appropriate OpenAPI decorators applied.

## Configuration

### SwaggerUiProviderOptions

The provider accepts configuration options that control both the API documentation and UI presentation.

```ts
interface SwaggerUiProviderOptions {
  api: SwaggerUiProviderApiOptions;
  ui?: SwaggerUiProviderUiOptions;
}
```

#### SwaggerUiProviderApiOptions

Controls the OpenAPI specification and API endpoint configuration.

```ts
interface SwaggerUiProviderApiOptions {
  openApiObject: OpenApi3Dot1Object;
  path: string;
}
```

Properties

- openApiObject (OpenApi3Dot1Object): The base OpenAPI 3.1 specification object. Controller metadata will be merged into this object.
- path (string): The base path where the Swagger UI will be served (e.g., '/docs').

#### SwaggerUiProviderUiOptions

Controls the Swagger UI presentation and customization options.

```ts
interface SwaggerUiProviderUiOptions {
  customCss?: string;
  customCssUrls?: string | string[];
  customJs?: string;
  customJsUrls?: string | string[];
  explorerEnabled?: boolean;
  swaggerUiOptions?: SwaggerUiOptions;
  title?: string;
}
```

Properties

- customCss (optional string): Inline CSS to customize the Swagger UI appearance.
- customCssUrls (optional string | string[]): External CSS stylesheet URLs to include.
- customJs (optional string): Inline JavaScript code to execute in the Swagger UI.
- customJsUrls (optional string | string[]): External JavaScript URLs to include.
- explorerEnabled (optional boolean): Whether to show the API explorer input in the top bar. Defaults to false.
- swaggerUiOptions (optional SwaggerUiOptions): Native Swagger UI configuration options.
- title (optional string): Custom page title for the Swagger UI interface.

## Internal Processing

### Metadata Collection

The provider automatically collects metadata from your controllers including:

- Controller base paths and OpenAPI metadata
- Method-level route definitions and OpenAPI operations
- Referenced schema types for request/response bodies
- Applied middleware and guard configurations

### OpenAPI Specification Building

The provider performs several key operations:

- Merges controller metadata into the base OpenAPI object
- Builds path item objects for each controller method
- Consolidates referenced schemas into the components section
- Maps HTTP methods to OpenAPI operations
- Resolves path parameters and request/response schemas

### Controller Registration

After building the complete OpenAPI specification, the provider:

- Creates a framework-specific Swagger UI controller
- Registers the controller in the dependency injection container
- Sets up routes for serving the Swagger UI interface and static assets:
  - `GET {path}`: Serves the Swagger UI HTML page
  - `GET {path}/spec`: Serves a JSON representation of the OpenAPI spec

## Error Handling

### Duplicate Operations

The provider will throw an error if duplicate operations are detected for the same path and HTTP method combination. This typically occurs when:

- Multiple methods in the same controller use the same route path and HTTP method
- Controller metadata conflicts exist

### Provision State

The provider maintains internal state to prevent multiple provisioning:

- Calling `provide()` more than once will throw an error
- This ensures consistency and prevents duplicate controller registrations

## Integration Requirements

### Controller Prerequisites

Controllers must meet the following requirements for proper documentation generation:

- Be registered in the Inversify container
- Have appropriate OpenAPI decorators applied (from the OpenAPI decorator library)
- Use consistent path definitions between HTTP route decorators and OpenAPI metadata
