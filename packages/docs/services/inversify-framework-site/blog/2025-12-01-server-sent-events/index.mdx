You know what's funny? We've been building real-time features with WebSockets for years, pulling in entire libraries, managing bidirectional connections, and writing custom reconnection logic. Meanwhile, there's been a simpler solution hiding in plain sight: **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.

And now it's ridiculously easy to use in InversifyJS.

## Why SSE?

Server-Sent Events is a web standard for pushing real-time updates from server to client over plain HTTP. It's unidirectional (server → client), works with standard HTTP, and browsers handle reconnection automatically.

Think about it: live notifications, dashboard metrics, activity streams, progress bars. Most "real-time" features don't need bidirectional communication - they just need the server to push updates. That's SSE's sweet spot.

## The Developer Experience

Here's what we aimed for: streaming real-time data should feel as natural as returning a value. No boilerplate, no connection management, just focus on what data to send.

This complete chat broadcasting system shows how simple real-time can be:

- Clients connect to `/chat/stream` and get a live SSE stream
- The `ChatService` manages all active streams  
- Post to `/chat/send` to broadcast to all connected clients
- Cleanup happens automatically on disconnect

The same pattern works for live sports scores, stock tickers, collaborative notifications - any pub/sub scenario.

## What You Get

**Zero client-side setup** - Every browser has `EventSource` built-in. No libraries, no configuration:

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/chat/stream');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => console.log(event.data);
// Browser handles reconnection automatically
```

**Works everywhere** - Express 4/5, Fastify, Hono, uWebSockets.js. Same API across all adapters.

**Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support for message events, including custom types, IDs, and retry hints.

**Production-ready** - Built-in backpressure handling, proper HTTP headers, automatic stream cleanup.

## When to Use SSE vs WebSockets

**Choose SSE when:**
- You only need server → client communication
- You want automatic reconnection without code
- You're working with standard HTTP infrastructure

**Choose WebSockets when:**
- You need true bidirectional communication (client ↔ server)
- You're building real-time games or collaborative editors with frequent client updates

For dashboards, notifications, and monitoring? SSE is the simpler choice.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install @inversifyjs/http-sse
```
