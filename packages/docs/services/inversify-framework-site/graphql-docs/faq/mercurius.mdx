# Mercurius integration

Mercurius is a GraphQL adapter for Fastify. It is very simple to set up and does not require an HTTP adapter from InversifyJS.

You can simply create a Fastify instance, register Mercurius, and start the server.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{mercuriusGraphqlServerSource}</CodeBlock>

If you want to use the InversifyJS HTTP adapter, you can get the Fastify instance by calling `adapter.build()` and then register Mercurius.

For more information, please refer to the [Mercurius documentation](https://mercurius.dev/).
